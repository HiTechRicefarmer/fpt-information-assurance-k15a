1. Contrast people of your age with those of your parents’ generation. 
Think about beliefs, values, goals, traditions, language, etc. 

	The difference between the current generation and their parents’ generation in Vietnam is striking. 
Their disparities range from the simplest aspects, such as age, to more complex subjects, such as values and beliefs. 
The three most important differences between these two age groups must be religion, goals, and traditions.

	First of all, the number of people who identify as religious is higher in the older generation, 
while younger people usually identify as atheists. The senior age group is usually devoted followers of 
Vietnam’s most common religions, including Buddism and Catholicism. They are also inclined to believe in 
superstitions. For example, business owners will see the first customer of the day as an indication of 
how well their shops will sell that day. Meanwhile, the younger generation is much less likely to worship 
any gods, nor do they attend church services or temple ceremonies as much as their parents. 

	Second of all, adolescents have intentions that are more focused on their well-being instead of aiming for 
a nuclear family as their end goal, like their parents. For example, a man born in the old generation might 
be inclined to aim for a white-collar career in an office with a mediocre wage and stability. In contrast, his 
descendant is likely to pursue a flexible job solely because it is aligned with his or her passion. 

	The final point is that older people are more likely to strictly adhere to traditions than younger people. 
Traditional beliefs and even prejudices are ingrained in the mindsets of older people. On the contrary, the newer 
generation is more open-minded and their opinions are generally progressive in nature. For instance, it is a common 
sentiment among the past generation that Vietnamese men and women must perform traditional gender roles, while in 
this generation, both genders are striving for more fairness in their duties. Moreover, older people put more 
importance on performing cultural rituals such as burning paper money or participating in worship ceremonies in 
local temples. On the other hand, younger people do not tend to pay attention to such formalities.

	In conclusion, there is a stark contrast between Vietnam’s two generations. The differences include their devotion 
to faith, their aim in life, and how they perform local traditions.

1. Some people believe computer and video games are harmful to children, while others disagree. 
What do you think? Take a position and defend it. 

	With the advancement of technology in the present day, computers and video games are showing up in almost all 
households across the country. However, there have been multiple differing opinions on their effects on children. 
Some argue that games have detrimental effects on children’s education, while others believe it is not. 
Due to multiple reasons, it is obvious that computer games and electronic devices bring a lot of benefits to juniors.

	The first reason is that video games provide entertainment value for schoolchildren. With the increasing pressure to 
perform well at school, youngsters are becoming more stressed. Video games in general and educational games in particular 
would provide several sources of recreation for students of all ages. The adequate amount of playtime provided by 
electronic games would allow students to balance between study and play, which would therefore lead to better performance 
at school. Coupled with the limited number of communal spaces for children to engage in pastimes in bigger cities, 
educational video games are an excellent source of relaxation for pupils.
Secondly, using computers encourages children to self-study. At academic facilities, students are often explicitly 
instructed to follow their teachers’ guidance. Their progress and knowledge are judged on a limited set of criteria determined 
by the school boards. On the contrary, juniors are able to pursue any subject of their liking by gathering helpful information 
on the Internet. Without the school's grading system, they can learn at their own pace and figure out creative approaches 
to certain problems.

	The final point is that there has been no evidence of technology or video games causing actual harm to the planet’s 
younger generation. As time progresses, computers and, additionally, video games become increasingly widespread in households. 
Children not having any access to modern technology is a rare occurrence, unlike in the last decade. Modern researches and
statistical analysis across different countries conclude that as technological appliances and games sales have gone up, 
so is the average IQ. In other words, the younger generation that has been exposed to computer games and electronic 
devices is more educated and more intelligent.

	In conclusion, technological devices will bring various benefits to children in this day and age. In addition, there has 
been no correlation between video games and a lack of education; so it can safely be assumed that games are not harmful 
to the development of children.

2. Not everyone chooses to go to a college or university. 
Discuss the reasons (causes) that make a person decide to go to college OR the results (effects) of getting a college degree 
OR of not going to college. Choose only one of these topics for your essay. 

	As higher education becomes more available for all classes of people and not restricted only to the wealthy, the percentage of 
individuals with a college degree is growing exponentially. There are several factors that contributed to this growth. Three of 
those are the pressure from society, hiring standards, and people believing college is the easiest way to succeed.

	Firstly, a significant number of people choose to pursue a college degree due to societal pressure. Human beings in general are 
quick to be influenced by their peers; for example, a person might decide to major in a subject they are not interested in only 
because their friends are doing the same. Furthermore, media outlets often praise people who went to prestigious universities or 
have high university entrance exam scores. This creates a burden on other students, inadvertently forcing them to pour every 
effort into college preparation. There is also a bias against people who only completed high school without continuing to university,
stereotyping them as unintelligent and dull.

	Secondly, as the supply of highly educated workers far exceeds the demand, higher education has become a requirement for job openings 
instead of being an advantage. In order to be qualified for jobs, students must have previous experience, skills, and a college degree. 
Career paths that do not require a bachelor’s degree at the least often have few prospects and lacking in benefits. Wanting to have a 
higher-paying job that can cover living expenses leaves no choice for high schoolers aside from going to college.
The last reason is that the majority of the population believes the easiest way to prosperity is to enroll in a university. As mentioned 
above, most jobs that have greater salaries require a degree. Most people think of university tuition fees as a financial investment, 
as they will be able to gain more money than people without a degree. Additionally, attaining a higher education also elevates one’s 
status in society, creating more opportunities for advancing further in life.

	In closing, the reasons stated above justify the decision to enroll in higher education facilities. These reasons range from being pressured 
by one’s companions, to getting better jobs, and lastly, for people to achieve great financial status and prestige.
